# IT276-midterm-platformer
This branch contains functionality for:
-Simple platforming: its a bit clunky but it works consistently
-Random level structure: current level pool is small so the tree doesn't seem very full, but it dynamically generates an n-ary tree based on the number of exits that each room has.
-VERY simple UI: only a "press space to play" button is implemented
-3 enemies: one that walks, one that jumps, and one that hovers
-1 boss: floats up and down while moving up and down. currently dies in one hit (most likely due to lack of hit invinsibility)

Code contains notes and comments about intended changes/improvements to be made
Some naming conventions are inconsistent, I plan to fix this.
